My journey to the Learn Verified program and learning software development has really been a journey of many steps.  I've always enjoyed using and learning about technology, so technology has alway been a part of my life.  However, software development had always remained a bit of a mystery to me.  Sure I took a couple programming classes in college so I understood the basics, but in those types of classes you don't make any of real value.  

Aftering graduating college and upon entering the workforce I found that effectively using technology was a good way to set myself apart from my peers.  But the technology I could use was limited to the Microsoft Office Suite.  

I also found as I progresses through my career that knowing how to effectively technology can save a significant amount of time and energy.  This is particularly true when a significant amount of data is involved.    


I find the process of programming to be extremely engaging.  The process of breaking down a problem into it's individual parts for me is both challenging and rewarding.  This processes has become a significant part of the way that I think.  Finding the individual steps for a task and then weighing the tradeoffs of possible solutions.
