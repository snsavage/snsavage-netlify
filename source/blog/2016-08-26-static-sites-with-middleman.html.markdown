![Static Sites with Middleman](static-sites-with-middleman.png "Static
Sites with Middleman")

In August 2016 I gave a talk at the [Lancaster Front-End
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/lancaster-front-end/) about static web sites and
the static site generator Middleman.

The talk covered some background on static
sites and static site generators, and then discussed why and when you might want
to use them.  The talk then covered the basics of Middleman.  

The presentation slides can be found [here](/assets/static-sites-with-middleman.pdf).
