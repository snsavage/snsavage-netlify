![Static Sites with Middleman](/images/cposc_2016_middleman.png "Static Sites
with Middleman")

In November 2016 I gave a talk at the [Central Pennsylvania Open Source
Conference](http://cposc.org) about creating static sites with the Middleman static site generator.

The talk starts with a discussion of the basics of static sites and static site
generators, then covers the Middleman static generator, and ends with an example
workflow that works for both developers and non-technical users.  

The presentation slides can be found [here](./cposc_2016_middleman.pdf).
