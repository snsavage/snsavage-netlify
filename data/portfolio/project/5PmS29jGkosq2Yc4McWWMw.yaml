  QuestionFair.com is a website for asking questions and getting answers. The website includes a few more advanced features including location tagging, points rewards and friendships with other users.

  QuestionFair.com was originally created as a final academic project for completion of a Master's degree in Information Systems. QuestionFair was built using the Ruby on Rails website framework. The site was launched March 2015, but is currently dormant and undergoing improvement for a future relaunch.
